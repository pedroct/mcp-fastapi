# HTTPConnection class - FastAPI

# `HTTPConnection` class[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/httpconnection/#httpconnection-class "Permanent link")

When you want to define dependencies that should be compatible with both HTTP and WebSockets, you can define a parameter that takes an `HTTPConnection` instead of a `Request` or a `WebSocket`.

You can import it from `fastapi.requests`:

`from fastapi.requests import HTTPConnection`

## fastapi.requests.HTTPConnection [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/httpconnection/#fastapi.requests.HTTPConnection "Permanent link")

`HTTPConnection(scope, receive=None)`

Bases: `Mapping[str, Any]`, `Generic[StateT]`

A base class for incoming HTTP connections, that is used to provide any functionality that is common to both `Request` and `WebSocket`.

`def __init__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive | None = None) -> None:     assert scope["type"] in ("http", "websocket")    self.scope = scope`
