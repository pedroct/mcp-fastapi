# APIRouter class - FastAPI

# `APIRouter` class[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/apirouter/#apirouter-class "Permanent link")

Here's the reference information for the `APIRouter` class, with all its parameters, attributes and methods.

You can import the `APIRouter` class directly from `fastapi`:

`from fastapi import APIRouter`

## fastapi.APIRouter [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter "Permanent link")

`APIRouter(     *,    prefix="",    tags=None,    dependencies=None,    default_response_class=Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>")),    responses=None,    callbacks=None,    routes=None,    redirect_slashes=True,    default=None,    dependency_overrides_provider=None,    route_class=APIRoute,    on_startup=None,    on_shutdown=None,    lifespan=None,    deprecated=None,    include_in_schema=True,    generate_unique_id_function=Default(generate_unique_id),    strict_content_type=Default(True) )`

Bases: `Router`

`APIRouter` class, used to group _path operations_, for example to structure an app in multiple files. It would then be included in the `FastAPI` app, or in another `APIRouter` (ultimately included in the app).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/).

#### Example[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter--example "Permanent link")

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

`responses`

Additional responses to be shown in OpenAPI.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Additional Responses in OpenAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/additional-responses/).

And in the [FastAPI docs for Bigger Applications](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-custom-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

OpenAPI callbacks that should apply to all _path operations_ in this router.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`routes`

**Note**: you probably shouldn't use this parameter, it is inherited from Starlette and supported for compatibility.

---

A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`redirect_slashes`

Whether to detect and redirect slashes in URLs when the client doesn't use the same format.

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`default`

Default function handler for this router. Used to handle 404 Not Found errors.

**TYPE:** `ASGIApp | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependency_overrides_provider`

Only used internally by FastAPI to handle dependency overrides.

You shouldn't need to use it. It normally points to the `FastAPI` app object.

**TYPE:** `Any | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`route_class`

Custom route (_path operation_) class to be used by this router.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Request and APIRoute class](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/custom-request-and-route/#custom-apiroute-class-in-a-router).

**TYPE:** `type[APIRoute]` **DEFAULT:** `APIRoute`

`on_startup`

A list of startup event handler functions.

You should instead use the `lifespan` handlers.

Read more in the [FastAPI docs for `lifespan`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Callable[[], Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`on_shutdown`

A list of shutdown event handler functions.

You should instead use the `lifespan` handlers.

Read more in the [FastAPI docs for `lifespan`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Callable[[], Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`lifespan`

A `Lifespan` context manager handler. This replaces `startup` and `shutdown` functions with a single context manager.

Read more in the [FastAPI docs for `lifespan`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).

**TYPE:** `Lifespan[Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark all _path operations_ in this router as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`include_in_schema`

To include (or not) all the _path operations_ in this router in the generated OpenAPI.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

`strict_content_type`

Enable strict checking for request Content-Type headers.

When `True` (the default), requests with a body that do not include a `Content-Type` header will **not** be parsed as JSON.

This prevents potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks that exploit the browser's ability to send requests without a Content-Type header, bypassing CORS preflight checks. In particular applicable for apps that need to be run locally (in localhost).

When `False`, requests without a `Content-Type` header will have their body parsed as JSON, which maintains compatibility with certain clients that don't send `Content-Type` headers.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Strict Content-Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/strict-content-type/).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `Default(True)`

### frontend [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter.frontend "Permanent link")

`frontend(     path, *, directory, fallback="auto", check_dir=True )`

Serve a static frontend build as low-priority routes.

Use this for frontend tools that build static files into a directory, such as `dist`. **FastAPI** path operations are checked first, and the frontend files are checked only if no normal route matched.

A typical project could look like this:

`. ├── pyproject.toml ├── app │   ├── __init__.py │   └── main.py └── dist     ├── index.html    └── assets        └── app.js`

Then in `app/main.py`:

`from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI app = FastAPI() router = APIRouter() router.frontend("/", directory="dist") app.include_router(router)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path prefix where the frontend build should be served.

**TYPE:** `str`

`directory`

The directory containing the static frontend build output.

**TYPE:** `str | PathLike[str]`

`fallback`

The fallback file behavior for missing frontend paths.

**TYPE:** `Literal['auto', 'index.html', '404.html'] | None` **DEFAULT:** `'auto'`

`check_dir`

Check that the frontend directory exists when the app is created.

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

Add a _path operation_ using an HTTP GET operation.

##### Example[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter.get--example "Permanent link")

`from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI app = FastAPI() router = APIRouter() @router.get("/items/") def read_items():     return [{"name": "Empanada"}, {"name": "Arepa"}] app.include_router(router)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

`name`

Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally.

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

`name`

Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally.

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

`name`

Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally.

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

##### Example[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter.options--example "Permanent link")

`from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI app = FastAPI() router = APIRouter() @router.options("/items/") def get_item_options():     return {"additions": ["Aji", "Guacamole"]} app.include_router(router)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

`name`

Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally.

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

`name`

Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally.

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`generate_unique_id_function`

Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI.

This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally.

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`callbacks`

List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.

This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).

PARAMETER

DESCRIPTION

`path`

The URL path to be used for this _path operation_.

For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.

**TYPE:** `str`

`response_model`

The type to use for the response.

It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.

It will be used for:

-   Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
-   Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
-   Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
-   Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

**TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`

`status_code`

The default status code to be used for the response.

You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

**TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`tags`

A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`dependencies`

A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).

**TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`summary`

A summary for the _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`description`

A description for the _path operation_.

If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_.

It can contain Markdown.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_description`

The description for the default response.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`

`responses`

Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `[dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[int | str, [dict](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#dict "Dict")[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`deprecated`

Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated.

It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

**TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`operation_id`

Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_.

By default, it is generated automatically.

If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.

You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).

**TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_include`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_exclude`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`response_model_by_alias`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_model_exclude_unset`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_defaults`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.

When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`response_model_exclude_none`

Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.

This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`

`include_in_schema`

Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema.

This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).

**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`

`response_class`

Response class to be used for this _path operation_.

This will not be used if you return a response directly.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).

**TYPE:** `type[[Response](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.Response "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.Response</span>")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default([JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class=\"doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class\"></code>            <span class=\"doc doc-object-name doc-class-name\">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span>"))`

**TYPE:** `[list](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/pt/python-types/#list "List")[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`

`openapi_extra`

Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_.
