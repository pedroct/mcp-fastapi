# Sub Applications - Mounts - FastAPI

# Sub Applications - Mounts[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#sub-applications-mounts "Permanent link")

If you need to have two independent FastAPI applications, with their own independent OpenAPI and their own docs UIs, you can have a main app and "mount" one (or more) sub-application(s).

## Mounting a **FastAPI** application[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#mounting-a-fastapi-application "Permanent link")

"Mounting" means adding a completely "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling everything under that path, with the _path operations_ declared in that sub-application.

### Top-level application[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#top-level-application "Permanent link")

First, create the main, top-level, **FastAPI** application, and its _path operations_:

[Python 3.10+](#__tabbed_1_1)

`from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get("/app") def read_main():     return {"message": "Hello World from main app"} subapi = FastAPI() @subapi.get("/sub") def read_sub():     return {"message": "Hello World from sub API"} app.mount("/subapi", subapi)`

### Sub-application[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#sub-application "Permanent link")

Then, create your sub-application, and its _path operations_.

This sub-application is just another standard FastAPI application, but this is the one that will be "mounted":

[Python 3.10+](#__tabbed_2_1)

`from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get("/app") def read_main():     return {"message": "Hello World from main app"} subapi = FastAPI() @subapi.get("/sub") def read_sub():     return {"message": "Hello World from sub API"} app.mount("/subapi", subapi)`

### Mount the sub-application[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#mount-the-sub-application "Permanent link")

In your top-level application, `app`, mount the sub-application, `subapi`.

In this case, it will be mounted at the path `/subapi`:

[Python 3.10+](#__tabbed_3_1)

`from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get("/app") def read_main():     return {"message": "Hello World from main app"} subapi = FastAPI() @subapi.get("/sub") def read_sub():     return {"message": "Hello World from sub API"} app.mount("/subapi", subapi)`

### Check the automatic API docs[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#check-the-automatic-api-docs "Permanent link")

Now, run the `fastapi` command:

`fastapi dev`

[fast →](javascript:void\(0\))fastapi dev  
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)  
  
[restart ↻](javascript:void\(0\))

And open the docs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

You will see the automatic API docs for the main app, including only its own _path operations_:

And then, open the docs for the sub-application, at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/subapi/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/subapi/docs).

You will see the automatic API docs for the sub-application, including only its own _path operations_, all under the correct sub-path prefix `/subapi`:

If you try interacting with any of the two user interfaces, they will work correctly, because the browser will be able to talk to each specific app or sub-app.

### Technical Details: `root_path`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#technical-details-root-path "Permanent link")

When you mount a sub-application as described above, FastAPI will take care of communicating the mount path for the sub-application using a mechanism from the ASGI specification called a `root_path`.

That way, the sub-application will know to use that path prefix for the docs UI.

And the sub-application could also have its own mounted sub-applications and everything would work correctly, because FastAPI handles all these `root_path`s automatically.

You will learn more about the `root_path` and how to use it explicitly in the section about [Behind a Proxy](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/).
